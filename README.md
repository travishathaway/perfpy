# perfpy

Profiles performance of Python scripts and CLI applications

## Installing

To install this package, run:

```sh
pip install perfpy
```

## Using

`perfpy` allows you to define a list of commands in a JSON file to profile and then returns 
its output as a CSV file. To use it, you first need to define the input JSON file. An example
of what that looks like it shown below:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name":  "sysconfig",
      "command": "python -m sysconfig"
    },
    {
      "name":  "zen_of_python",
      "command": "python -m this"
    }
  ]
}
```

With this filed saved as `to_profile.json`, we'll be able to generate a report with the following
command:

```shell
perfpy to_profile.json
```

This generates the following report in `report.csv`:

```csv
name,command,bytes_recv,bytes_sent,user_time,cpu_time,total_time,max_memory_usage
sysconfig,python -m sysconfig,0,1024,0.016999,0.006522,44651500,11919.36
zen_of_python,python -m this,0,0,0.026629999999999997,0.011214,27247125,11919.36
```

To view the CLI help information, run:

```shell
perfpy --help
```
